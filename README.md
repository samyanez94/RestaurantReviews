# RestaurantReviews
Seventh app of the [Treehouse iOS Development Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/ios-development).


This app fetches businesses reviews using the [Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/fusion). The app finds nearby businesses and presents them in an map view and table view. The user is able to select different businesses and learn more details including hours, prices, and reviews. This app was built as a way to learn more about Core Location, MapKit, writing networking code using protocols and generics, and asynchronous operations.
